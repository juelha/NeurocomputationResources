> "A theory is not a legal document and, in spite of occasional suggestions to the contrary, no scientist is in communication with the Almighty." [Leon N Cooper and Mark F. Bear](https://brabeeba.github.io/neuralReadingGroup/cooper.pdf)

> "We maintain a small shrine devoted to reviewer 3. In all fairness to reviewers 1 and 2, the manuscript was dramatically improved in response to their critiques." [Gina G Turrigiano](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5247594/#fn-group1)

> "It would be easy to think of this early revelation as a piece of extraordinary luck. It would of course have been very bad luck had we quit after 5 hours instead of going on for 9. But we rather think of the discovery as the result of Swedish and Canadian dogged persistence.” [Hubel & Wiesel](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627300809848)
